1. (Number Theory Context) In cryptography, prime numbers are used for encryption keys. Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers of the form 4n + 3, which are particularly important in certain modular systems.

2. (Calculus Context) In advanced physics and statistics, integrals like this appear in distribution functions. Evaluate the integral:
   ∫₀^∞ (x^(a-1)) / (1+x) dx for 0 < a < 1.

3. (Differential Equations in Engineering) A damped harmonic oscillator is modeled by the equation y'' + 4y' + 5y = 0. Solve it using the given initial conditions: y(0) = 2, y'(0) = 0.

1. (Gravitational Physics) On a newly discovered exoplanet, gravity increases with altitude. Derive the time period for a pendulum on a planet where gravitational acceleration varies linearly with height.

2. (Classical Mechanics) A particle is constrained in a potential field given by V(x) = (1/2)kx² + α/x². This is common in quantum confinement studies. Find the condition for stable equilibrium.

--- Chemistry ---

1. (Molecular Bonding) Oxygen gas (O₂) is paramagnetic, which contradicts the Lewis structure. Use molecular orbital theory to explain why O₂ has unpaired electrons.

2. (Acid-Base Chemistry) You're in a lab mixing acetic acid and sodium acetate to create a buffer. Calculate the pH of a solution made by mixing 100 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid with 100 mL of 0.1 M sodium acetate.

--- Computer Science ---

1. (Computability Theory) Explain why the Halting Problem cannot be solved by any program, no matter how advanced. This is a foundational concept in theoretical computer science.

2. (Algorithms and Trees) In a software development environment, binary trees are often used for organizing data. Write an algorithm that finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.

--- Literature ---

1. (Narrative Analysis) In "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden often misleads the reader. Explain how the unreliable narrator technique shapes our understanding of his character and actions.

2. (Theme Comparison) In both "Frankenstein" and "The Metamorphosis," characters face isolation. Compare how each author uses alienation to critique society and explore the human condition.
